# Generic Drug Adoption Analysis
## Project Status

This project is wrapped up as a **learning case**.  

- **Original Goal**: Build a decision tool to predict when generics enter the U.S. market and estimate savings.  
- **Key Finding**: Publicly available data (Orange Book patents, CMS Medicare spending) is insufficient for predicting generic entry timing. Generics often launch **before patent expiry** due to settlements and exclusivity deals, which makes accurate forecasting impossible with this dataset.  
- **What Works**:  
  - Cleaned and merged CMS Part D and FDA Orange Book data.  
  - Built pipelines to analyze **brand vs. generic spending backtests** around launch events.  
- **Takeaway**: While the main research question was infeasible, the project strengthened my skills in **data cleaning, pipeline design, and documentation** and produced reusable components for future work.
